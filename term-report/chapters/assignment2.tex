\section{Matching point sets by brute force or RANSAC}

To many possibilities
Q1: Calculation for all the points with equations

Q2: To many possibilities/would take to long chance really small to choose the same 3 points inn the correct order

\section{Implement/test the affine transformation}

Apply the transformation to each point in the left set, find the point in the right set that is the closest and accumulate the sum of the squared error distance. Also show the projected points to validate the transformation.

\section{Structuring point sets by triangulation}
