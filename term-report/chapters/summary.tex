It is time to reflect on this whole semester of Computer Vision. It definitely was a lot of work but on the other hand also quite interesting. Although the content was rather complex it was well explained and (mostly) understandable during the lecture. It was really interesting for me to start at the beginning with the basics and evolve to rather complex topics. From a basic circle detection in a binary image to feature tracking in a video. I also enjoyed that we applied these theoretical concepts to practical problems. It was great to get some insight on the basics of computer vision algorithms but in addition I would love to get some more information on state of the art computer vision concepts/algorithms which are used today as well as best practices or different frameworks which are used in real world applications at the moment. But since this course already is pretty packed with information I understand that it would be too much information but a follow up course in that direction would be really interesting.
